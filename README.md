# phone-directory
Contact directory using bootstrap, css and jquery

Phone directory is a web app to create new contact, delete old contact.

## Installation

You need jQuery and bootstrap to run the project.
I've linked and uploaded both the files in the repository.


## Usage

```
import jquery and bootstrap files

 $(".add_contact").click(function() // opens a modal to add new contact
 $("table tbody").append(markup);// adds new contact
$(document).on("click", ".delete", function(){
	$(this).parent().parent().remove();
			});// deletes a contact
```
